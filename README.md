### enter info and steps (cleaning etc etc here -- was all done in PowerBI(incl. cleaning) etc

### This is a sample project made in PowerBI with an outline of the steps below:
1) Data Source and Data Cleaning.
   
  I obained the data, which is a real survey conducted to inquire data professionals about their salaries, job roles
  and related info. 
  The data was obtained here: 
  https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx 

2) Data cleaniing steps:
  
   I decided to perform all of the data cleaning steps from within PowerBI (i.e. not prior to in the original .csv file)
   While it can be generally easier to perform much if not all of initial data cleaning steps outside of PowerBI,
   I wanted to make use  of the included toolset for this project.
