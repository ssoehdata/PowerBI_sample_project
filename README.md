# Notes on the Data Professional Survey Project
### enter info here etc

### This is a sample project made in PowerBI with an outline of the steps below:
1) Data Source and Data Cleaning.
   
  I obained the data, which is a real survey conducted to inquire data professionals about their salaries, job roles
  and related info. File format is a .csv file.
  The data was obtained here: 
  https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx 

2) <d>Data cleaning steps and comments:</d>
  
   I decided to perform all of the data cleaning steps from within PowerBI (i.e. not prior to in the original .csv file)
   While it can be generally easier to perform much if not all of initial data cleaning steps outside of PowerBI,
   I wanted to make use  of the included toolset for this project.

   A short list of some of the data cleaning I performed:
   
      a) AVG SALARY
            I Separated salary values from ranges to average values. For example, salaries were
            given by the paricipants as
            as ranges e.g. 60K- 100K USD. The averages for theses data points were then calculated so that I could represent
            average salary values from the survey.
