#### This is a sample project made in PowerBI with an outline of the steps below:
1) Data Source
   
  I obained the data, which is a real survey conducted to inquire data professionals about their salaries, job roles
  and related info. File format is a .csv file.
  The dataset was obtained here: 
  https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx 

2) <d>Data cleaning:</d>
  
   I decided to perform all of the data cleaning steps _within PowerBI_ (i.e. not prior to in the original .csv file). <br>
   While it can be easier to perform much if not all of initial data cleaning steps outside of PowerBI, I wanted to use the<br>
   included toolset for this project.

   Sample list of some of the data cleaning steps:
   
   a) AVG SALARY<br>
   <d>Separated salary values from ranges to average values. Salaries were
   given by the paricipants as ranges (e.g. 60K- 100K USD).<br>The averages for theses data points were
   then calculated so that I could represent average salary values from the survey.</d>
